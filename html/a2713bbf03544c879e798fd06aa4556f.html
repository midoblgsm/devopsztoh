<p>The Swagger project is the original foundation of the Open API Specification, consisting of the Swagger Specification and the Swagger tools.&nbsp; The Swagger Specification&nbsp;is the origin of OAS, the world&rsquo;s standard for defining RESTful interfaces. The OAS enables developers to design a technology-agnostic API interface that forms the basis of their API development and consumption. The tools behind Swagger allow developers to design their products in an API first manner. The can start by agreeing on the API using the Swagger editor that allows to describe the API specification with all its models while being able to try it and documented. Then they can even generate the server and client initial codes to accelerate the development and make sure that the code is in compliance with the API.</p>
