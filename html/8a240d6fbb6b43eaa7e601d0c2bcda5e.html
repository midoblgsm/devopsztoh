<p>We reached the end of this journey, but it is only the beginning of your DevOps career. As mentioned in the first section of the course, this is not meant to make you an expert in all of the techniques we discussed, but rather to make you aware of their existence and to give you a teaser for each one of them. Now if you want to dive deeper in any particular subject, you can proceed with the little knowledge that you learned already. This will help you get started, and it is your job to sharpen your skills and become a better DevOps engineer.</p>
<p>During the last couple of weeks, we got an introduction for go programming and how to write a REST application in go. We transformed our application into a container that runs in any platform using docker. Afterwards we learned about kubernetes and used it to do a multi-container deployment. In the fourth session, we took a brief look at TDD and how to write tests for our code and went deeper in how to create a CICD pipeline. In the last session, we learned about service meshes and we used istio to get more observability about our applications and to&nbsp;apply different&nbsp;techniques of traffic management.</p>
<p>I hope that you learned one or few things that will make you become a better you. Please take the last quiz to evaluate your knowledge and take the exit survey and compare it to your entry survey (the one we did in the beginning of the course.). The last thing, please share any feedback (positive or negative) that you have&nbsp;by emailing me at mohamed@wethink.info.</p>
<p>If you are not a hero, keep trying to become one.</p>
