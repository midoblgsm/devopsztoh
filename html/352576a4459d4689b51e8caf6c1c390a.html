<p>We want to implement a shopping cart&nbsp;with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user should be able to instantiate an empty cart</li>
<li>A user can add/remove products to/from his cart</li>
<li>A user can consult the content of the cart, unique items or total number of items</li>
<li>A user can check the total cost of his cart</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the types that we need to define here?</p>
<p>For implementing this simple use case, I created a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/midoblgsm/shoppingcart" target="_blank">github repo</a> that you can use. We will be using the same repository for the following weeks. Each week will be added to a separate branch. Please try the implementation yourself before jumping to the solution.</p>
