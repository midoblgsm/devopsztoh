<p>Cloud platforms provide a wealth of benefits for the organizations that use them. However, there&rsquo;s no denying that adopting the cloud can put strains on DevOps teams. Developers must use microservices to architect for portability, meanwhile operators are managing extremely large hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. Istio lets you connect, secure, control, and observe services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At a high level, Istio helps reduce the complexity of these deployments, and eases the strain on your development teams. It is a completely open source service mesh that layers transparently onto existing distributed applications. It is also a platform, including APIs that let it integrate into any logging platform, or telemetry or policy system. Istio&rsquo;s diverse feature set lets you successfully, and efficiently, run a distributed microservice architecture, and provides a uniform way to secure, connect, and monitor microservices.</p>
<p>Istio makes it easy to create a network of deployed services with load balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, and more, with few or no code changes in service code. You add Istio support to services by deploying a special sidecar proxy throughout your environment that intercepts all network communication between microservices, then configure and manage Istio using its control plane functionality, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic load balancing for HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, and TCP traffic.</li>
<li>Fine-grained control of traffic behavior with rich routing rules, retries, failovers, and fault injection.</li>
<li>A pluggable policy layer and configuration API supporting access controls, rate limits and quotas.</li>
<li>Automatic metrics, logs, and traces for all traffic within a cluster, including cluster ingress and egress.</li>
<li>Secure service-to-service communication in a cluster with strong identity-based authentication and authorization.</li>
<li>Istio is designed for extensibility and meets diverse deployment needs.</li>
</ul>
