<p>Jaeger, inspired by Dapper and OpenZipkin, is a distributed tracing system released as open source by Uber Technologies. It is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed context propagation</li>
<li>Distributed transaction monitoring</li>
<li>Root cause analysis</li>
<li>Service dependency analysis</li>
<li>Performance / latency optimization</li>
</ul>
<p>Istio comes with a tracing setup based on Jaeger, you can access it on&nbsp;<a href="http://tracing.myistio.com:31519/" target="_blank">http://tracing.myistio.com:31519/</a>. The dashboard will look like the following:</p>

<p>The different spans that you can see show the advantages that Jaeger offers. You can easily see how many calls are happening and how much time is each call taking. You can easily understand where your application is taking more time and can detect any issues really quick.</p>
