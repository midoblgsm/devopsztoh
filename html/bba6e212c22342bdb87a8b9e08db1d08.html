<p>Test Driven Development or TDD is a methodology that many developers and companies are adopting to detect software anomalies in early stages of the development when the cost is still considerably low. TDD is illustrated in the diagram below and consists of making fast iterations of adding small failing tests that reflect the required behaviour of the system. Then making the needed changes to make the tests succeed. By repeating the exercise&nbsp;over and over again&nbsp; to drive your development, TDD forces you to write only the minimum amount of code that respects your requirements. It also allows to detect any behaviour that deviates from your specification. TDD also allows the detection of when and where refactoring is needed.</p>

<p>In TDD it is a blasphemy to write functional code before writing a failing test for it first. Once the test is written and is failing, the developer writes the needed code to make it pass the test.</p>
<p>For TDD practitioner, the test suites are the best place to seek documentation, since the tests describe how to use the software, when it succeeds and when it fails. A well written test then becomes a significant portion of the technical documentation.</p>
<p>In Go there are many frameworks for writing tests. There is even a testing library that comes with the Go setup. In this course we will use&nbsp;<a href="http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/" target="_blank">ginkgo</a> and <a href="http://onsi.github.io/gomega/" target="_blank">gomega</a>. Ginkgo is a test framework for Go language while Gomega is a matcher library that allows to describe the expectations of the test results.</p>
