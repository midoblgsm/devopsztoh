<p>For convenience, I created a SwaggerHub repository for our use case. You can copy the API description to Swagger Editor and change it. Try to add the missing methods, don't forget to add the needed data models. If the window is not big enough, you can jump in to&nbsp;<a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/midoblgsm/ShoppingCart/0.0.1" target="_blank">https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/midoblgsm/ShoppingCart/0.0.1</a>.</p>
<p height="1200" width="100%"><iframe title="Swagger" src="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/midoblgsm/ShoppingCart/0.0.1" height="1000" width="100%">
  
</iframe></p>
<p>SwaggerHub allows to manage different versions of the API. Check out the version 1.0.0 that I added. How close was it to your version?</p>
<p>Once you are done making your changes, you can generate the server&nbsp;stub or a client SDK&nbsp;for the API. You can also generate the fancy documentation for your API.&nbsp; Go ahead and give it a try to see how close was it from our initial code.</p>
