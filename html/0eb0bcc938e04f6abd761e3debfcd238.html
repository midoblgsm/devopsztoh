<p>We want to implement a shopping cart where with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user should be able to instantiate an empty cart</li>
<li>A user can add/remove products to/from his cart</li>
<li>A user can consult the content of the cart, unique items or total number of items</li>
<li>A user can check the total cost of his cart</li>
</ul>

<p>To get started go back to the folder where you clone the github repository and checkout the week2initial branch:</p>
<p><span face="monospace, serif" style="font-family: monospace, serif;">git checkout week2initial</span></p>
<p>Then open the folder in your favorite editor and let's try to test drive our use case. If you feel puzzled, don't worry, developers who are not used to TDD can find it challenging in the beginning, but after few iterations, they can get used to it and it might become their best way to write code. We will go through this in the live session. If you want to proceed, you can check out some code that I put together in the github repository under week2 branch.</p>
