<p>REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems and was first presented by Roy Fielding in 2000 in his dissertation.</p>

<p>REST is a used to simplify client-server communication. It allows to create a unified layered interface that makes the integration easier. REST is also stateless, this means that any request contains all the information that is needed to understand and fullfill the request.</p>
<p>As its name says, REST is all about resources state transfer. A request generally is an HTTP REST call that asks for reading or changing the state of a given resource.</p>
<p>Let's stop the theory and start the practice!</p>
