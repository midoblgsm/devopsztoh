<p>Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.</p>
<p> Go has many advantages that made many big projects and organisations adopt it. Some of these projects are: Kubernetes, Docker, CloudFoundry and others. Go focuses on simplicity, conciseness, readability ,concurrency and performance.  
</p>
Some of the advantages of Go that makes it appealing for developers:
<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Concurrency</b>: Executing more than one task simultaneously and making progress is known as concurrency. Go has rich support for concurrency using goroutines and channels</li>
  <li><b>A goroutine</b> is a function capable of running concurrently with other functions. We can easily create and execute thousands of Goroutines</li>
 <li> <b>A channel</b>  is a way for two Goroutines to communicate with each other and synchronize their execution.</li>

  <li><b>Static Binaries</b>:  Go does not have an interpreter or a virtual machine that some other languages have. Go directly compiles code and convert it to binaries.
</li>
  <li><b>Garbage Collector</b>: Go has its own garbage collector which takes care of bookkeeping of resources and is used to allocate and remove the objects.</li>
</ul>
