<p>In order to get started with Swagger there are two places you can start from: Swagger Editor or SwaggerHub.</p>
<p>Swagger Editor starts with an API example that used almost all supported features in API design. It is a temporary editor that you can use to get familiar with the specification. For enterprise projects, teams use SwaggerHub to collaborate on their APIs, persist then and generate try them out.</p>
<p>Please take a look at both and get yourself familiar with the syntax.</p>
