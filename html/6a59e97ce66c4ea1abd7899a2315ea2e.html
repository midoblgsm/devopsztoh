<p>Istio uses different concepts to do traffic management and enable all the features that it offers. I will present few of them that we will need during our course. You can look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://istio.io/docs/concepts/" target="_blank">official documentation</a> for the list of concepts and get the latest updates.</p>
<h5>Gateway</h5>
<p>You use a gateway to manage inbound and outbound traffic for your mesh, letting you specify which traffic you want to enter or leave the mesh. Gateway configurations are applied to standalone Envoy proxies that are running at the edge of the mesh, rather than sidecar Envoy proxies running alongside your service workloads.</p>
<p>Gateways are primarily used to manage ingress traffic, but you can also configure egress gateways. An egress gateway lets you configure a dedicated exit node for the traffic leaving the mesh, letting you limit which services can or should access external networks, or to enable secure control of egress traffic to add security to your mesh, for example. You can also use a gateway to configure a purely internal proxy.</p>
<h4>Virtual Service</h4>
<p>Virtual services play a key role in making Istio&rsquo;s traffic management flexible and powerful. They do this by strongly decoupling where clients send their requests from the destination workloads that actually implement them. Virtual services also provide a rich way of specifying different traffic routing rules for sending traffic to those workloads.</p>
<p>Why is this so useful? Without virtual services, Envoy distributes traffic using round-robin load balancing between all service instances. You can improve this behavior with what you know about the workloads. For example, some might represent a different version where you might want to configure traffic routes based on percentages across different service versions, or to direct traffic from your internal users to a particular set of instances.</p>
<p>With a virtual service, you can specify traffic behavior for one or more hostnames. You use routing rules in the virtual service that tell Envoy how to send the virtual service&rsquo;s traffic to appropriate destinations. Route destinations can be versions of the same service or entirely different services.</p>
<h4>Destination Rules</h4>
<p>Along with virtual services, destination rules are a key part of Istio&rsquo;s traffic routing functionality. You can think of virtual services as how you route your traffic to a given destination, and then you use destination rules to configure what happens to traffic for that destination. Destination rules are applied after virtual service routing rules are evaluated, so they apply to the traffic&rsquo;s &ldquo;real&rdquo; destination.</p>
<p>In particular, you use destination rules to specify named service subsets, such as grouping all a given service&rsquo;s instances by version. You can then use these service subsets in the routing rules of virtual services to control the traffic to different instances of your services.</p>
